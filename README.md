### Date created
25.11.2024

### Project Overview
In this project, you will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

## Bike Share Data
In this project, you will use data for a a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
The Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

   - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
   - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
   - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
   - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
   - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
   - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
